This repository provides a machine learning framework for the subjective tinnitus diagnosis â€” a condition characterized by the perception of sound without an external source. 
The code supports data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation, aiming to assist clinical decision-making and support research reproducibility. Ideal for researchers, clinicians, and developers working in audiology and AI-driven healthcare.
